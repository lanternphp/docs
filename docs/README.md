### Why Lantern?  

Laravel is a _great_ framework that [has no opinion about how your application should be structured](https://laravel.com/docs/master/structure#introduction):

> The default Laravel application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications. But you are free to organize your application however you like.

This is a huge part of the attraction of Laravel; it allows a developer to express themselves. **Lantern is one such expression.** 

<div class="features"><div class="feature">

## üì¢ Declarative

The ==features== and ==actions== of your app are explicitly declared to your Laravel app.
The functionality of your app becomes apparent just by looking at your file structure.
    
</div><div class="feature">

## üèòÔ∏è Co-location

By ensuring each ==action== has its own class, it attracts the relevant behaviour.
For example, the code for the ==availability== of an ==action== sits alongside the ==action== itself, making it easier to reason about your application.

</div><div class="feature">

## üè∞ Laravel-powered

Lantern takes `advantage` of its deep integration with Laravel & its ecosystem to ensure your app always feels like a LaravelÔ∏è app. 

Start small with a single action:<br>
[Get started ‚Üí](/documentation/installation) üë£

</div></div>

By following Lantern‚Äôs conventions in organising your domain code, you get extra stuff thrown in for free:

- [x] Easy to scan the file structure 
- [x] Apply system ==constraints== to an ==action== or ==feature==, such as whether a particular binary can be found
- [x] Restrict ==availability== of an ==action== according to the current user, the current state of your domain model ‚Ä¶etc.  
- [x] Each ==action== registers an authorisation gate that can be checked from middleware, a controller, a blade template  
- [ ] Record the most recent ==actions== performed by each user 
- [ ] Add in session-level debug info to an exception when it occurs, e.g. the ==action== history of the user
