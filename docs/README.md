### Why Lantern?  

Laravel is a _great_ framework that [has no opinion about how your application should be structured](https://laravel.com/docs/master/structure#introduction):

> The default Laravel application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications. But you are free to organize your application however you like.

This is a huge part of the attraction of Laravel; it allows a developer to express themselves. **Lantern is one such expression.**

We believe that, by following declarative coding conventions, you can improve the quality of your application
and have the domain model you have built become much more evident within your code.

<div class="features"><div class="feature">

## 📢 Declarative

Declare the domain model of your application through Actions, grouped into Features.
The functionality of your app becomes apparent just by looking at your file structure.
    
</div><div class="feature">

## 🏘️ Co-location

Each Action sits in its own class, attracting information and behaviour relevant to that Action.
For example, the code for the Availability of an Action sits alongside the Action itself, making it easier to reason about your application.

## 🏰 Laravel-powered

Lantern takes advantage of its deep integration with Laravel & its ecosystem to ensure your app always feels like a Laravel️ app.
