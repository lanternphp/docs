# FAQ

## Do I have to use Lantern for all of my domain code 

Nope.

We're confident you'll love the additional structure and clarity Lantern will give your application, and there's no
better way of testing this out than adding in 1 or 2 of your actions and seeing how it feels.

Lantern won't interfere with the rest of your app in the slightest, so you're free to continue hitting those eloquent models and repositories from
the rest of your controllers, it just won't feel as nice.

## Can't I just organise my Controllers using the Lantern way?

Sure, but Lantern is more than just code organisation. It uses the way ==Actions== are explicitly declared to
integrate more deeply into Laravel. For example, each action automatically registers an [Authorisation Gate](https://laravel.com/docs/master/authorization#gates)
so you can easily check what the current user is able to do. You can't do that with a controller.

Beyond that, it's also likely that you'll have your own Artisan commands, so controllers never really tell the whole story.

## What's on the horizon for Lantern?

We're always looking at ways of improving Lantern, and more deeply integrating with Laravel so you get more 
out-of-the-box functionality for free.
