# Credits

Following years of (relatively low-level) frustration with different Laravel
apps being built in a slightly different way, and never quite remembering the
approach that each app took, [we](https://brightmachine.uk/) were on the lookout
for something better. 

The "aha moment" came after reading [A new idea: Feature Driven Development](http://www.montanafloss.co/blog/feature-driven-development)
by Marc Palmer, a local app developer, who had put this idea into action with the [Flint framework](https://flint.tools/)
for Swift apps.

Lantern takes this same high-level approach, and applies it to the world of web apps.
